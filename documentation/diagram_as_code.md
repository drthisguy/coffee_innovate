# Diagram as Code: Creating Visual Representations Programmatically

## Overview

Diagram as Code is a powerful approach to creating and maintaining visual representations of systems, architectures, and processes using code rather than traditional graphical tools. This project focuses on generating diagrams in SVG and PNG formats, providing a flexible and version-control friendly way to create and manage diagrams.

## What is Diagram as Code?

Diagram as Code is a methodology where diagrams are defined using a domain-specific language (DSL) or a general-purpose programming language. Instead of using drag-and-drop interfaces, you describe your diagram elements and their relationships in code. This approach offers several advantages:

1. **Version Control**: Diagrams can be tracked in version control systems like Git, allowing for easy collaboration and change tracking.
2. **Automation**: Diagrams can be generated automatically as part of CI/CD pipelines or documentation processes.
3. **Consistency**: Enforcing a standardized style and layout across all diagrams becomes easier.
4. **Scalability**: Managing large numbers of diagrams becomes more efficient.
5. **Reusability**: Common elements and patterns can be abstracted into reusable components.

## Key Concepts

### 1. DSL (Domain-Specific Language)

Many Diagram as Code tools use a custom DSL to describe diagrams. These DSLs are designed to be intuitive and expressive for diagram creation.

Sample from this project

  ```shell
Knowledge Base Discovery [icon: aws]{
	// Nodes and groups
	
	KBD Input S3 [icon: aws-s3, label: "s3: Raw Documentation, Meetings, Emails, Conversations, etc., "]

	Knowledge Base Discovery Processing [icon: aws-lambda] {
	  KBD Approval Pipeline [icon: aws-codepipeline, label: "Iteration: Approval and Editing"]
    
	}

	KBD Output S3 [icon: aws-s3, label: "Result Knowledge Base Documentation"]
}

// Connections
	KBD Input S3 > Knowledge Base Discovery Processing
	Knowledge Base Discovery Processing >  KBD Output S3
        Knowledge Base Discovery Processing  > Knowledge Base Discovery Processing 
  ````

### 2. Programmatic Definition

Some tools allow you to define diagrams using general-purpose programming languages like Python or JavaScript.

Example (using Python):
```python
from diagramming_lib import Diagram, Database, Service

with Diagram("System Architecture"):
    user_db = Database("User DB")
    auth = Service("Auth Service")
    gateway = Service("API Gateway")

    user_db >> auth >> gateway
```

### 3. Rendering Engines
The code is processed by a rendering engine that generates the final diagram in SVG or PNG format. These engines handle layout algorithms, styling, and export functionality.

### 4. Styling and Themes
Most Diagram as Code tools provide ways to customize the look and feel of diagrams through themes or style definitions.

#### Use Cases
**Software Architecture**: Visualize system components and their interactions.
**Infrastructure Diagrams**: Represent cloud or on-premises infrastructure setups.
**Network Topologies**: Illustrate network layouts and connections.
**Workflow Diagrams**: Depict business processes or data flows.
**Entity-Relationship Diagrams**: Visualize database schemas and relationships.
#### Benefits of Diagram as Code
**Maintainability**: Easier to update and maintain diagrams over time.
**Collaboration**: Leverage code review processes for diagram changes.
**Integration**: Embed diagram generation into documentation or build processes.
**Consistency**: Ensure all team members produce diagrams with a consistent style.
**Flexibility**: Quickly generate variations of diagrams for different purposes.

### 5. Getting Started
To start using Diagram as Code with this project:

a. Install the required dependencies (listed in requirements.txt).
b. Choose a DSL or programming approach for defining your diagrams.
c. Write your diagram definitions.
d. Use the provided tools to render your diagrams in SVG or PNG format.
For detailed examples, please refer to our Documentation.

### 6. Conclusion
Diagram as Code offers a powerful, flexible, and maintainable approach to creating visual representations. By leveraging programming concepts and version control, it brings the benefits of software development practices to the world of diagramming.
