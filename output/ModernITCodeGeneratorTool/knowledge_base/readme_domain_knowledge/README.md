Based on the provided README content, I'll extract the domain-specific knowledge as requested:

1. Business context and requirements:
   - The project is a set of chess piece graphics for use in various applications
   - The graphics are designed for both black/white printouts and high-resolution displays
   - The package is intended for free use, including commercial applications

2. Domain terminology and concepts:
   - 96x96: Refers to the pixel dimensions of the graphics
   - Grayscale: Images using shades of gray rather than full color
   - ADOBE type 1 font: A specific font format developed by Adobe
   - "SKAK": The name of the font used to create the chess piece graphics
   - Antialiased: A technique to smooth jagged edges in digital graphics

3. Core business processes:
   - Creation of chess piece graphics using a specific font
   - Distribution of the graphics package as freeware

4. System boundaries and constraints:
   - Graphics are limited to 96x96 pixel dimensions
   - Images are in grayscale format
   - The package is derived from the ADOBE type 1 font "SKAK"

5. Integration patterns and workflows:
   - Users can freely use, change, and integrate the graphics into their projects
   - The package allows for extraction and conversion of the graphics
   - Attribution to the author is required when using the graphics

Note: The provided README doesn't contain extensive information about integration patterns and workflows, so the information in that section is limited.
