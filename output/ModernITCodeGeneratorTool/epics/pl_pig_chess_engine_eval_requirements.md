# Chess Engine Evaluation Module - Agile Requirements Documentation

## 1. Epic Overview

### Epic Title
Chess Engine Evaluation Module Development

### Epic Description
Develop a robust and efficient chess engine evaluation module that accurately assesses chess positions, generates moves, and provides a strong playing strength for a chess application.

### Business Value
- Enhance the overall playing strength of the chess application
- Improve user engagement and satisfaction with challenging gameplay
- Provide a foundation for future AI-driven chess features

### Success Metrics
- Achieve an ELO rating improvement of at least 200 points compared to the previous engine
- Reduce evaluation time by 30% for complex positions
- Increase the depth of search by at least 2 ply within the same time constraints

## 2. Features

### 1. Position Evaluation
**Description**: Implement a comprehensive position evaluation function that considers material balance, piece positioning, pawn structure, king safety, and other chess principles.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Utilize bitboards for efficient board representation
- Implement piece-square tables for positional evaluation
- Consider both middlegame and endgame evaluation

**Dependencies**:
- Chess library for board representation and move generation

### 2. Move Generation and Selection
**Description**: Develop an efficient move generation algorithm and a move selection mechanism based on the evaluation function and search techniques.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Implement alpha-beta pruning for efficient search
- Consider move ordering techniques to improve search efficiency
- Implement quiescence search for tactical accuracy

**Dependencies**:
- Position Evaluation feature

### 3. Opening Book Integration
**Description**: Integrate an opening book to improve the engine's play in the early stages of the game.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Develop a format for storing and accessing opening moves
- Implement a mechanism to select moves from the opening book

**Dependencies**:
- Move Generation and Selection feature

### 4. Endgame Tables
**Description**: Implement endgame tablebases for perfect play in certain endgame positions.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Integrate Syzygy tablebases
- Develop a mechanism to detect tablebase positions and retrieve optimal moves

**Dependencies**:
- Position Evaluation feature
- Move Generation and Selection feature

## 3. User Stories

### Feature: Position Evaluation

#### Story 1: Basic Material Evaluation
**As a** chess engine developer,
**I want** to implement basic material counting,
**So that** the engine can accurately assess the material balance of a position.

**Story Points**: 3
**Priority**: Must Have

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The evaluation function correctly calculates the material balance for all piece types.
2. Different piece values are assigned for middlegame and endgame phases.
3. The material evaluation is integrated into the overall position evaluation score.

#### Story 2: Piece-Square Table Implementation
**As a** chess engine developer,
**I want** to implement piece-square tables,
**So that** the engine can assess the positional value of pieces on different squares.

**Story Points**: 5
**Priority**: Should Have

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Piece-square tables are implemented for all piece types.
2. The tables provide different values for middlegame and endgame phases.
3. The piece-square values are correctly integrated into the position evaluation score.

#### Story 3: Pawn Structure Evaluation
**As a** chess engine developer,
**I want** to evaluate pawn structures,
**So that** the engine can assess the strength and weaknesses of pawn formations.

**Story Points**: 8
**Priority**: Should Have

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The evaluation function detects and evaluates doubled pawns.
2. Isolated and backward pawns are identified and penalized.
3. Pawn chains are recognized and evaluated based on their strength.

### Feature: Move Generation and Selection

#### Story 4: Legal Move Generation
**As a** chess engine developer,
**I want** to generate all legal moves for a given position,
**So that** the engine can explore possible continuations.

**Story Points**: 5
**Priority**: Must Have

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. All legal moves are generated for any given chess position.
2. Special moves like castling and en passant are correctly handled.
3. The move generation is efficient and does not significantly impact performance.

#### Story 5: Alpha-Beta Pruning Implementation
**As a** chess engine developer,
**I want** to implement alpha-beta pruning,
**So that** the engine can efficiently search through the game tree.

**Story Points**: 13
**Priority**: Must Have

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Alpha-beta pruning is correctly implemented in the search algorithm.
2. The search depth is increased compared to a basic minimax search.
3. The algorithm correctly handles the alpha and beta bounds.

#### Story 6: Quiescence Search
**As a** chess engine developer,
**I want** to implement quiescence search,
**So that** the engine can accurately evaluate tactical positions.

**Story Points**: 8
**Priority**: Should Have

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Quiescence search is implemented to evaluate capturing moves beyond the regular search depth.
2. The quiescence search correctly handles check evasions.
3. The overall tactical accuracy of the engine is improved.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the chess engine evaluation module project, including the epic, major features, and detailed user stories. It can be used as a foundation for agile development, helping to guide the implementation and track progress throughout the project.
