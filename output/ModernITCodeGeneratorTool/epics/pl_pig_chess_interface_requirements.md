3. The algorithm returns the best move found within the given constraints

### Feature: Position Evaluation

#### Story 6: Basic Position Evaluation
**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement a basic position evaluation function,
**So that** the engine can assess the relative strength of each side in a given position.

**Story Points:** 5
**Priority:** Must Have

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The function correctly counts material balance
2. The function detects checkmate and stalemate positions
3. The function returns a numerical score representing the position's evaluation

#### Story 7: Advanced Evaluation Techniques
**As a** chess enthusiast,
**I want** the engine to use more advanced evaluation techniques,
**So that** it can make more accurate assessments of chess positions.

**Story Points:** 8
**Priority:** Should Have

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Implement piece-square tables for positional evaluation
2. Consider factors such as pawn structure and king safety
3. Properly weight different evaluation factors for a balanced assessment

### Feature: User Interface
