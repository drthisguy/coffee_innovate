# Chess Engine Evaluation Module Documentation

## 1. Overall Purpose and Functionality

This Python module implements a chess engine with a focus on position evaluation. The main components are:

- `ChessEngineEval`: A class for evaluating chess positions
- `ChessEngine`: A class that uses the evaluator to make moves in a chess game

The engine is designed to play against a human player, making moves based on position evaluation and allowing for interactive gameplay.

## 2. Detailed Function Descriptions

### ChessEngineEval Class

#### `__init__(self)`
Initializes the evaluator with default values for various parameters used in position evaluation.

#### `pdN(self, brik_n: int, felt: int) -> int`
Calculates an index for piece-square tables based on piece number and square.

#### `pdX(self, brik: str, felt: int) -> int`
Calculates an index for piece-square tables based on piece character and square.

#### `initialize(self)`
Sets up initial state for the evaluator, including piece-square tables.

#### `pre_process(self)`
Placeholder for pre-processing logic before evaluation.

#### `pre_processor(self, board: chess.Board)`
Placeholder for pre-processing logic that takes a chess board as input.

#### `eval(self, board: chess.Board, activity: int, black: bool, alpha: int, beta: int) -> int`
Main evaluation function. Currently returns 0 as a placeholder.

### ChessEngine Class

#### `__init__(self)`
Initializes the chess engine with an evaluator.

#### `make_move(self, board: chess.Board) -> chess.Move`
Placeholder for move generation and selection logic.

#### `evaluate_position(self, board: chess.Board) -> int`
Evaluates the current board position using the evaluator.

## 3. Input/Output Specifications

### ChessEngineEval.eval
- Inputs:
  - `board`: A `chess.Board` object representing the current position
  - `activity`: An integer representing activity level
  - `black`: A boolean indicating if it's Black's turn
  - `alpha`: An integer for alpha-beta pruning
  - `beta`: An integer for alpha-beta pruning
- Output: An integer representing the evaluation score

### ChessEngine.make_move
- Input: `board`: A `chess.Board` object representing the current position
- Output: A `chess.Move` object representing the chosen move

### ChessEngine.evaluate_position
- Input: `board`: A `chess.Board` object representing the current position
- Output: An integer representing the evaluation score

## 4. Usage Example

```python
from chess_engine import ChessEngine
import chess

engine = ChessEngine()
board = chess.Board()

while not board.is_game_over():
    if board.turn == chess.WHITE:
        move = engine.make_move(board)
        print(f"Engine's move: {move}")
    else:
        move = chess.Move.from_uci(input("Enter your move: "))

    if move in board.legal_moves:
        board.push(move)
    else:
        print("Illegal move, try again.")

print("Game over. Result:", board.result())
```

## 5. Important Notes and Considerations

1. This is a skeleton implementation. The core evaluation logic in `ChessEngineEval.eval` and move generation in `ChessEngine.make_move` need to be implemented.

2. The code uses the `chess` library for board representation and move generation. Make sure to install it using `pip install chess`.

3. The `ChessEngineEval` class contains many attributes that are likely used in the evaluation process. Their exact usage needs to be implemented in the `eval` method.

4. The `pre_process` and `pre_processor` methods are placeholders and should be implemented based on the specific pre-processing needs of the engine.

5. The engine currently plays as White against a human player. To change this, modify the main game loop logic.

6. Error handling and input validation (beyond checking for legal moves) are minimal and should be enhanced for a robust implementation.

7. The evaluation function currently returns 0, which means the engine will make random legal moves. Implementing a proper evaluation function is crucial for meaningful gameplay.

8. The code structure allows for easy extension and modification of the evaluation logic and move selection criteria.
