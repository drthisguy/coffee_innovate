Here's a comprehensive documentation for the provided Python chess engine code:

1. Overall Purpose and Functionality:
This code implements a basic chess engine using the python-chess library. The engine allows for playing chess games with various levels of AI opponents, making moves, evaluating positions, and finding the best moves using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

2. Detailed Function Descriptions:

ChessEngine Class:
- __init__(): Initializes the chess engine with default settings.
- new_game(): Starts a new game with specified parameters.
- do_move(): Makes a move on the board.
- do_bot_move(): Makes a move for the AI bot.
- get_bot_level(): Determines the bot's level for the current move.
- find_best_move(): Finds the best move for the current position.
- minimax(): Implements the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
- evaluate_position(): Evaluates the current board position.
- output_position(): Outputs the current board position.
- set_white(): Sets the white player's level.
- set_black(): Sets the black player's level.
- takeback_move(): Takes back the last move.
- takeback_moves(): Takes back the last two moves.

Test Functions:
- test_position(): Tests the engine on a specific position.
- run_test_suite(): Runs a test suite on the engine.

3. Input/Output Specifications:

- new_game(white, black, start_position, theory_mode, interaction_mode):
  Input: Player levels, starting position (FEN), theory mode, interaction mode
  Output: None (sets up the game)

- do_move(move_str):
  Input: Move in UCI format (e.g., 'e2e4')
  Output: None (makes the move if legal)

- find_best_move(depth):
  Input: Search depth
  Output: Best move found (chess.Move object)

- evaluate_position():
  Input: None
  Output: Float (evaluation score)

4. Usage Examples:

```python
# Create a chess engine instance
engine = ChessEngine()

# Start a new game
engine.new_game(white=2, black=0)  # AI (level 2) vs Human

# Make moves
engine.do_move("e2e4")
engine.do_move("e7e5")

# Let the AI make a move
engine.do_bot_move()

# Change AI levels
engine.set_white(4)
engine.set_black(2)

# Take back moves
engine.takeback_moves()

# Run tests
test_positions = [
    "r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3",
    "r3k2r/p1ppqpb1/bn2pnp1/3PN3/1p2P3/2N2Q1p/PPPBBPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 1"
]
run_test_suite(engine, test_positions, depth=4)
```

5. Important Notes and Considerations:

- This implementation uses the python-chess library, which needs to be installed (`pip install python-chess`).
- The AI levels are simplified (0=human, 2=low, 4=medium, 6=high) and directly affect the search depth.
- The evaluation function is basic and only considers material balance. Advanced engines would include positional factors.
- The engine's strength is limited by the search depth and the simple evaluation function. Increasing depth will improve play but significantly increase computation time.
- The code includes basic error handling for illegal moves but may not cover all edge cases.
- The interaction_mode and theory_mode parameters are included but not fully implemented in this version.
- Performance optimizations, opening books, and endgame tablebases are not implemented in this basic version.

This chess engine provides a foundation for understanding how chess AI works and can be extended with more advanced features for improved play strength and efficiency.
