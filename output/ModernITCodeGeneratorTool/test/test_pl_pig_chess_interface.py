This test suite covers various aspects of the `ChessEngine` class, including:

1. Initialization of new games with default and custom parameters
2. Making legal and illegal moves
3. Bot move execution (with mocking)
4. Bot level calculation
5. Best move finding at different depths
6. Minimax evaluation, including checkmate scenarios
7. Position evaluation
8. Taking back moves
9. Setting player levels
10. Testing specific positions
11. Running a test suite

To run these tests, you'll need to have `pytest` installed. You can run the tests using the command:

```
pytest test_chess_engine.py
```

Make sure to adjust the import statement at the top of the test file to correctly import your `ChessEngine` class.

These tests provide good coverage of the main functionality of the chess engine. However, you may want to add more tests for edge cases, error handling, and any additional features you implement in the future.
